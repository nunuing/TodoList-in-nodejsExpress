# Node.js Express Practice

This project was created to practice CRUD operations.

## Flow Chart

Here is the flow chart of this web page:

## Wireframe

Here is the wireframe of the web page:

The wireframe was created using Figma. Initially, I didn't plan to use a modal window for adding or modifying lists. My idea was to add an input line below the last list and convert it into a normal list when the client finishes writing the content. However, I faced difficulties implementing this feature, so I decided to use modal windows for adding and modifying lists.

## Front-end Implementation

The front-end part was implemented using HTML, JavaScript, and some jQuery.

## Database

I used MySQL to store the list information. Here is the database schema:

The number column serves as the primary key, and I utilized the auto-increment feature in MySQL to automatically assign a value to the number when adding a new list.

## Web Server

The web server was implemented using Node.js. Initially, I didn't plan to include a web server, but I decided to implement one to enhance the functionality. While implementing the CRUD methods after creating the front-end part, I encountered an issue with data exchange between HTML and JavaScript files. As a solution, I changed the code format of the front-end part to .ejs.

## Demonstration

Here is a video demonstrating all the functions of the web page:
